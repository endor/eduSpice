### Preparations

Open <https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor> in a browser.

### Tasks

1. Draw four different versions of a stick figure with moving legs.
2. Add a new sprite, call it Suvi and add the stick figures as costumes.
3. Switch between the costumes with a small delay and move Suvi forward so it appears as if she is walking.
4. Play footstep sounds, so it also sounds like she is walking.
5. When she has reached half of the screen, make another sprite, called Toni, appear on the other side of the screen.
6. Make Suvi and Toni wave at each other by adding more costumes for each of them with waving hands.
